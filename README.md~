The forum is based on Anax-MVC, a PHP-based and MVC-inspired (micro) framework / webbtemplate / boilerplate for websites and webbapplications. Anax is built by Mikael Roos, [me@mikaelroos.se](mailto:me@mikaelroos.se). Read more at [https://github.com/mosbth/Anax-MVC](https://github.com/mosbth/Anax-MVC)
